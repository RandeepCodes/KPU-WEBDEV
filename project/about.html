  <h1>PAST PRESENT FUTUTRE</h1>
  
  <p id="paragraph">Kingsports was founded in 2004 by out beloved late. Sardar Tara Singh (grand-father of our leader Randeep Singh) in India.
   He used to play Hockey and Cricket a lot during his younger age which motivated him to open a next-door sports shop for the town of
   Gajsinghpur to introduce different sports to the children. He used to travel on trains for shipping equipments from a big town named
   Sri ganganagar which was 70 Kms far from Gajsinghpur. At first he only transported Hockey and cricket bats but as new sports came to the 
   town by means of institutions he expanded the stock to Badminton and Volleyball also. The shop started to get popular dayt by day because 
   of quality of products and service. Hence, he gave contracts to his friends in other nearby town to open more branches in 2007, 2009 and 2010.
   <br><br>
   From 2010 Mr.jagdev singh son of tara singh started to manage the family business as grandfather were going to take retirement. The father 
   showed great dedication and branches were opened all over the state. Now, we have 10+ branches in India and and still increasing. In 2015, 
   we decided to provide shipping all over India online so we made a website which had great positive impact on business as sales went 300% in just
   1.5 years of time.
   <br><br>
   Today son of Jagdev singh (Mr. Randeep Singh) took his family business to new heights by opening a branch here in Canada becoming the first brand 
   to be in Canada from Rajasthan. Branch was opened a year ago and a dedicated new website with great features is launched just a month ago as you 
   are reading this information on website indeed. We are trying to expand here in Canaada by hoping to open more branches in Toronto and montreal in
   next 5 years. We are recognized by Canadian government twice this year and they ensured us great opportunities in upcoming future.<br><br>
